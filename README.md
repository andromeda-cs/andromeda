Andromeda (stylized "andromeda") is a project that has the goal of allowing people to make an OS that they'd actually use.

Every OS made with andromeda is not actually a from-scratch OS, they're a Linux distro. andromeda allows you to create your own Linux distro and write parts of it using C#.

Currently, we have almost nothing to show, but we are developing quickly and we will update this README when andromeda has more and more to show.
